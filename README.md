# 🧮 Python Math Expression Interpreter

This project is a lightweight Python interpreter for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions. It includes features like lexing, parsing, and building an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Perfect for learning about compilers and interpreters! 🚀

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Integer and float number support.
- ➕ Basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
- 🔄 Grouping with parentheses: `( )`.
- ➖ Unary operations: `+`, `-`.
- 🛠️ Error handling with detailed position tracking.

## 💡 How It Works
1. **🖋 Lexer**: Converts input text into tokens.
2. **🌳 Parser**: Analyzes tokens and constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
3. **⚡ Interpreter**: (Not included yet—feel free to contribute!) Executes the AST to compute results.

## 📝 Example
Input:
```python
2 * (5 - 3)
